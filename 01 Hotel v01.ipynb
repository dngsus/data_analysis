    "\n",
    "**1) Prioritize retention and risk mitigation in the \"Online TA\" segment**<br>\n",
    "- Accounts for >50% of all successful bookings\n",
    "- Has been more volatile in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019:\n",
    "    - 32% rise in cancellations, therefore responsible for 106% of increase in cancellations\n",
    "- Stabilising this segment is critical to maintaining overall booking volume and revenue consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Reassess strategy for the \"Offline TA/TO\" segment**<br>\n",
    "- Improvement in cancellations (-20%) in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019\n",
    "- However, number of actual revenue-generating bookings dropped 36% - this is the biggest contributor to the 2020 YTD revenue shortfall, as this segment makes up about 23% of successful bookings (completed, or cancelled and non-refundable)\n",
    "- Revival is a high priority\n",
    "- Ideas examples:\n",
    "    - Increased engagement with travel agents\n",
    "    - Review of channel-specific pricing and package offerings\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Investigate root causes of longer lead times in general**<br>\n",
    "- Whilst lead times for completed bookings have increased, so too have lead times for cancelled bookings, in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019.\n",
    "- I.e. indicator of potential fragility: disturbs confidence in long-term revenue forecasting and management\n",
    "- Possibility: previously introduced feature unintentially made reservations more tentative"

    "**Fly-by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Revenue for 2018 (partial) far surpassed by equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "- Main driver is number of bookings, not increased value of bookings\n",
    "    - Especially in market segment **\"Online TA\"**, but also worth highlighting **\"Offline TA/TO\"** and **\"Direct\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) YTD revenue 2020 almost matches that of equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "- Sustainable: consistent month-by-month revenue growth in 2020\n",
    "- Same three important market segments as mentioned above contributed proportionally to overall number of bookings as much in both 2019 and 2020\n",
    "- However, number of revenue-generating bookings by secondary key segment \"Offline TA/TO\" decreased 36% in 2020 YTD vs 2019 YTD - _action point 2_\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Encouraging: though number of bookings overall decreased, quality went up (\"quality booking\" := generated revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Encouraging: longer average lead times in 2020 vs 2019, both overall and specifically in reference to those 3 major segments\n",
    "- However,  lead time of cancelled bookings increased too, again for all 3 major segments - _action point 3_\n",
    "\n",
    "5) (4) is especially noteworthy given the completion rate of bookings fell and actual number of cancellations rose in general, and most apparently in the key segment \"Online TA\" - _action point 1_"
