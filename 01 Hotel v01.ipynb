    "**Action Points**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Prioritize retention and risk mitigation in the \"Online TA\" segment**\n",
    "This segment accounts for over 50% of all successful bookings, but has been more volatile in 2020 YTD, with a 6 p.p. drop in completion rate and a 32% rise in cancellations. Stabilising this segment is critical to maintaining overall booking volume and revenue consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Reassess strategy for the \"Offline TA/TO\" segment**\n",
    "Despite an improvement in cancellations (-20%), the number of completed bookings for this segment has dropped 37%. This is the biggest contributor to the 2020 YTD reenue shortfall, as this segment makes up about 22% of successful bookings. Reviving it is a high priority. Ideas include increased engagement with travel agents, and reviwing of pricing and package offerings specific to this channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Investigate root causes of longer lead times in general**\n",
    "Whilst lead times for completed bookings have increased, so too have lead times for cancelled bookings, in 2020 YTD. This indicates potential fragility, and prevents us from confidently reaping benefits like longer-term revenue forecasting and maangement. It is worth exploring hypotheses such as that a previously introduced feature has unintentionally made reservations more tentative. This is likely to require more detailed operational knowledge and/or cross-functional input."

    "**Fly-by:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) YTD revenue 2018 far surpassed by equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "2) (1) is mainly driven by increased number of bookings, not increased value of bookings\n",
    "3) (2) is driven by (a) more bookings across both hotel types, especially city ones; (b) more bookings especially in market segment **\"Online TA\", but also \"Offline TA/TO\" and \"Direct\"**\n",
    "4) YTD revenue 2020 almost matches that of equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "5) (4) seems sustainable in the sense that month-by-month revenue is growing in 2020, so is not just a temporary boost due to extranous factors\n",
    "6) In 2020 and 2019 alike, those 3 important market segments in (3) contributed roughly the same amounts proportionally to total (completed) bookings per year\n",
    "7) However, number of bookings by secondary key segment \"Offline TA/TO\" decreased 37% in 2020 YTD vs 2019 YTD - _action point 2_\n",
    "8) We may be encouraged by longer average lead times in 2020 vs 2019, indicating confidence by customers in making advanced bookings, and suggesting opportunities for more assured revenue management and forecasting. This is true for all 3 major segments\n",
    "9) However, the lead time of cancelled bookings increased too, again for all 3 major segments, so there are fragilities to be wary of. This factor offsets the optimism offered in (8) - _action point 3_\n",
    "10) (9) is especially noteworthy given the completion rate of bookings fell and actual number of cancellations rose in general, and most apparently in the key segment \"Online TA\" - _action point 1_"
