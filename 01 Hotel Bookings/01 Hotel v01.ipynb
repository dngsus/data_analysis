    "**1) Prioritize retention and risk mitigation in the \"Online TA\" segment**<br>\n",
    "- Accounts for >50% of all successful bookings\n",
    "- Has been more volatile in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019:\n",
    "    - 32% rise in cancellations, therefore responsible for 106% of increase in cancellations\n",
    "- Stabilising this segment is critical to maintaining overall booking volume and revenue consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Reassess strategy for the \"Offline TA/TO\" segment**<br>\n",
    "- Improvement in cancellations (-20%) in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019\n",
    "- However, number of actual revenue-generating bookings dropped 36% - this is the biggest contributor to the 2020 YTD revenue shortfall, as this segment makes up about 23% of successful bookings (completed, or cancelled and non-refundable)\n",
    "- Revival is a high priority\n",
    "- Ideas examples:\n",
    "    - Increased engagement with travel agents\n",
    "    - Review of channel-specific pricing and package offerings\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Investigate root causes of longer lead times in general**<br>\n",
    "- Whilst lead times for completed bookings have increased, so too have lead times for cancelled bookings, in 2020 YTD versus equivalent dates 2019.\n",
    "- I.e. indicator of potential fragility: disturbs confidence in long-term revenue forecasting and management\n",
    "- Possibility: previously introduced feature unintentially made reservations more tentative"

    "\n",
    "1) Revenue for 2018 (partial) far surpassed by equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "- Main driver is number of bookings, not increased value of bookings\n",
    "    - Especially in market segment **\"Online TA\"**, but also worth highlighting **\"Offline TA/TO\"** and **\"Direct\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) YTD revenue 2020 almost matches that of equivalent-period 2019\n",
    "- Sustainable: consistent month-by-month revenue growth in 2020\n",
    "- Same three important market segments as mentioned above contributed proportionally to overall number of bookings as much in both 2019 and 2020\n",
    "- However, number of revenue-generating bookings by secondary key segment \"Offline TA/TO\" decreased 36% in 2020 YTD vs 2019 YTD - _action point 2_\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Encouraging: though number of bookings overall decreased, quality went up (\"quality booking\" := generated revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Encouraging: longer average lead times in 2020 vs 2019, both overall and specifically in reference to those 3 major segments\n",
    "- However,  lead time of cancelled bookings increased too, again for all 3 major segments - _action point 3_\n",
    "\n",
    "5) (4) is especially noteworthy given the completion rate of bookings fell and actual number of cancellations rose in general, and most apparently in the key segment \"Online TA\" - _action point 1_"

    "At a glance, there are observations on relative cancellation rates across market segments that do make sense against prior known business logic:\n",
    "- Complementary bookings involve less stake from the customer, freeing them to act in their own private interests\n",
    "- Direct bookings tend to be demonstrative of greater intent, thus less likely cancellation\n",
    "- Likewise when comaring offline vs online - online vendors make cancellation relatively easy; the notes from web sources at beginning of this section reflect that too\n",
    "- Corporates too are more confident / cautious in their bookings, therefore cancel less often\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to foresee that owing to its size and cancellation rate, that online TA is an important segment to look into.<br>\n",
    "The 35% rate here is comparable to the previously listed figures for online cancellation rates, listed below as reminder:\n",
    "- 38% (article published 2016)\n",
    "- 2015 to 2018: 32.5%, 34.8%, 39.6%, 41.3%, 39.6%\n",
